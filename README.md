## Project Overview

SwipeFlix is an interactive mobile application designed for users to browse, select, and manage movie and TV series recommendations through a fun and engaging swiping interface. By integrating movie metadata from IMDb, it allows users to explore a wide range of films and series, swipe to like or dislike, and create personalized watchlists based on their preferences.

Key features:
- **Swipe-based interaction**: Users can swipe right to add a movie or series to their favorites or swipe left to discard it.
- **Personalized recommendations**: The system uses the user's swiping history to suggest relevant content.
- **Data integration**: Pulls movie/TV series data from IMDb for up-to-date content.
- **User collections**: Users can view, edit, and manage their watchlists.
- **Backend API**: Supports data fetching, user watchlist management, and recommendations.
