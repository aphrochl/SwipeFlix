SwipeFlix

How does it work?

Tap on the start button, then the first swipe to launch the application. Then, swiping on the like and dislike buttons and tap to save movies on the corresponding WatchLate button. Furthermore, with a tap on the setting button we control the application settings and can read more app info, as well as from the baricons we can tap again either to return to the original, or to see our lists, or to be transferred to the search page to find the next movie (where the keyboard appears on the search bar) from left to right. In addition, from the homepage by clicking on the frame of the film, we can read details about each film. Finally, on the same page by pressing the WebIcon we are taken to the film's site on IMDb.

We point out that the components we have on the prototype page only serve for interactions, however they are the same as those in the assets.
