# Project Directions

These are the project directions for phase 2, as given by the professor.

## Phase 2: Final Figma Prototype

In the second phase of the six-month project, you will deliver a **complete functional prototype** of your application in Figma. 

You can change the app concept entirely from Phase 1, especially if feedback from the first phase suggests a change.

### Focus:
- Limit the **size** and **resource requirements** of the application.
- Focus on the **interaction elements**.

---

### Figma Prototype Requirements

This is a **team project** and should be built based on a **team library**.

#### Design System:
- We recommend using **Material Design 3**, which has a design kit you can duplicate.
- Publish the necessary components and styles to your team library.
- You may also import components from other `.fig` files or use a different design system, as long as it fits the application needs.

#### Data:
- Use **dummy data** for images and text if necessary.

---

### Required Pages

The project must contain the following **4 pages**:

1. **Assets**
2. **Wireframes**
3. **Final UI**
4. **Prototype**

---

### Assets Page
- Present the assets and components of the application according to the **atomic design philosophy**, from **atoms** to **organisms**.
- Follow Figma’s organizational system for **components** and **styles**.
- Components should be designed with **variants**, **instances**, and **states** where applicable.

---

### Wireframes Page
- Present all wireframes of the application using **atomic design templates**.
- This page should contain only **page borders** with minimal text to explain what each element does—no graphical enrichment.

---

### Final UI Page
- Present the **complete UI** (atomic design pages), which are the finalized versions of the wireframes.
- Use assets and components from the corresponding assets page.

---

### Prototype Page
- Implement a **functional prototype** of the application using interactions and flows.
- The prototype should be based on the **Final UI** page, with the addition of interactions and flows.
- Include at least **one gesture** other than tap (if not done already).
- Ensure the prototype works **cyclically**, meaning each flow should allow navigation back to the home page.

---

### Phase 2 Delivery Instructions

- Share the project and set the permissions to "**Anyone with the link can edit**".
- Copy the share link.
- Open an **incognito/private tab** and make sure the link works, and that the prototype functions when pressing the **Play** button in the top-right corner.
  
**Note**: The deliverable does not include file uploads. Instead, submit an **online rich text document** containing the **share link** for the project/prototype and any comments you may have.
