# Project Directions

These are the project directions for phase 3, as provided by the professor.

## Phase 3: Functional Demo in Flutter

In the third and final phase of the six-month project, you will deliver a **working demo** of your application using Flutter.

---

### Layout and Navigation

- Implement the **layout** for your application's screens.
- Set up **navigation** for transitioning between screens.
- Use simple **button presses** or **gestures** for transitions, depending on what fits best for your application.
- Follow the prototype created in **Phase 2** to maintain consistency.

---

### Text, Images, and Data

- Use **StatefulWidgets** if your application processes data when switching between screens.
- Your application must persist data, whether locally or through a remote database, both:
  - **Between screens**
  - On **opening** or **login**.
- Ensure the application can **transmit** and **modify** data across screens. Avoid having non-functional screens with static data.

---

### Android Subsystems

- Integrate Android subsystems (e.g., **camera**, **sound**) using the official **Dart** and **Flutter** package repository.

---

**Note**: The final demo should reflect the functionality outlined in your Phase 2 prototype. Ensure a seamless experience with proper data management and screen transitions.
