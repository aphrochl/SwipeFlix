# SwipeFlix 1st Phase:
[The Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/GzHiegnNaE0Vrh1ktmcqwg/Prototype-of-our-Super-Duper-Awesome-App?type=design&t=eZNPtfMlJK3yp3k8-6)

## Project Directions

### Phase 1: Idea Proposal - Prototype

In the first phase, you should present your idea with **low-fidelity prototyping** and **rapid implementation methods**.

### Scope and Interaction Capabilities:
Your application should not be complex and should not do many different things. Instead, it should perform a **specific functionality** and do it well or better than existing applications.

You can achieve this:
- At the **hardware level** by leveraging mobile device capabilities
- At the **software level** through advanced interaction techniques

### App Categories Not Recommended:
The following categories either have too general a scope or are **saturated** with existing applications, leaving limited room for innovation:
- Fitness and medical
- Diet
- Shopping
- Booking (restaurants, concerts, trips, courses)
- Wallet/budget management

### Deliverable

#### Text Deliverables:
For **Phase 1**, you should include:

1. **Application Title**: Include a short title if available.
   
2. **Promo Text / Punchline**: A short, one-line promotional statement.

3. **Description**: Up to 400 characters. This should be a one-paragraph application description that addresses the end user. (Examples of such descriptions can be found on Google Play.)

4. **Functional Requirements**: 
   - Identify functionalities for all user groups.
   - At least **one functionality** should relate to **Axis 1**.
   - Two functionalities should relate to **Axes 2** (except input) and **3** of the HCI application concept selection.
   
   **Note:** Please refer to these functionalities separately.

#### Wireframes:
Design your application's screen outlines (wireframes). You can create them:
- **By hand** (paper prototyping)
- **In Figma** (using a wireframing kit)
- **Using any other design program** you prefer.

For **Figma**: 
- Only frames/wireframes are needed in this first phase.
- Do **NOT** fully prototype the application in Figma, as this will be required in Phase 2.

You may accompany the wireframes with **explanations** of your application's functionality.
